Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in C++ during my learning journey.

Context

Hi, I’m Humza—a 40-year-old senior sound designer who started learning C++ just 51 days ago. 
This project is my way of applying what I’ve learned so far while exploring how programmers think and solve problems. I’d love your feedback and suggestions to help me improve and learn more about coding practices.

Please do not be surprised if you find something completely stupid, I gave it my best with whatever I know now. Surely I will refactor this in much better ways when I learn more. 

Features
	•	Two-player mode
	•	Players can choose X or O
	•	Automatically checks win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)

Areas for Improvement
	•	Handle edge cases more gracefully
	•	Improve user experience (better prompts and clearer messages)
	•	Use more descriptive variable names
	•	Debug a bug causing a repetition of a prompt, which I couldn’t figure out

Why I Built This

This project represents a milestone in my programming journey. It showcases my growing understanding of:
	•	Basic data types
	•	Strings
	•	Loops
	•	Functions

I’ve also experimented with references and minimal pointer usage, even though my knowledge of them is still very basic.

Mor than just a project, this is my gateway to the GitHub community. I’m hoping to learn from your reviews, insights, and suggestions to better understand real-world practices for solving problems and writing code.

Thank you so much for your time, reviews, and suggestions, they are really priceless to me! 🙏
